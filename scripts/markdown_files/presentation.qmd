## Goals

-   Analyze the spatio-temporal structure of Malaria infection in Nigeria
-   Determine which covariates are likely correlated with infection rates
-   Compare model frameworks to determine the best level of complexity for the data

## Background (WHO 2024)

-   "Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes."
-   "It is mostly found in tropical countries, \[but\] it is preventable and curable."
-   "Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries."
-   "\[The African continent\] carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden."
-   Many countries have been able to eliminate the disease entirely

## Previous Analyses

-   Previous attempts at spatiotemporal mapping of Malaria data have been done in the past.
-   Ogunsakin et al.'s paper *GIS-based spatiotemporal mapping of malaria prevalence and exploration of environmental inequalities* models on clusters of point data.
    -   Identified Nigeria as the country with the highest Malaria incidence
    -   Showed importance of climate features in modeling
    -   Data mostly in southern areas of Nigeria

## Data Collection

-   Malaria Infection rates in Nigeria collected from Malaria Atlas Project
    -   Measured at the state level between 2010 and 2022
-   Covariate climate data collected from World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal
    -   We include climate metrics as a predictor since previous analyses have shown them to be statistically significant
-   State boundary shapefiles collected from World Bank Data Catalog

## Temporal Analysis

- Indication of trend in Malaria infection rates over time

- Decline in the early 2010’s followed by a slight uptick in the early 2020’s

## Temporal Analysis

## General Modeling Framework {.smaller}
- We employ a variation of the model described by Lance Waller and Brad Carlin in Chapter 14 of the *Handbook of Spatial Statistics*
- Bayesian approach in which spatio-temporal structure is modeled via sets of autocorrelated random effects
$$ 
Y_{kt} \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_{kt}) \\
\ln(\mu_{kt}) = \beta x^T_k + O_{kt} + \psi_{kt} \\
O_{kt} \text{ is some offset term} \\
\psi_{kt} \text{ is some spatio-temporal random effect} 
$$

- We plan on modeling $\psi_{kt}$ with a CAR prior as porposed by Knorr-Held (2000)
- Implemented using R package `CARBayes` and `CARBayesST`
  + Uses MCMC

## Knorr-Held CAR prior {.smaller}

\begin{align}
\psi_{kt} &= \phi_k + \delta_t \\
\phi_k | \phi_{-k} \mathbf{W} &\sim N(\frac{\rho_S \sum_{j=1}^k w_{kj} \phi_j}{\rho_S \sum_{j=1}^k w_{kj} +1 - \rho_S} , \frac{\tau_S^2}{\rho_S \sum_{j=1}^k w_{kj} +1 - \rho_S }) \\ 

\delta_k | \delta_{-k} \mathbf{D} &\sim N(\frac{\rho_T \sum_{j=1}^N d_{kj} \delta_j}{\rho_T \sum_{j=1}^N d_{kj} +1 - \rho_T} , \frac{\tau_T^2}{\rho_T \sum_{j=1}^k d_{tj} +1 - \rho_T }) \\

\tau^2_S, \tau^2_T &\sim \text{Inverse-Gamma}(a,b) \\

\rho_S, \rho_T &\sim \text{Uniform}(0,1)

\end{align}

- $w_{ij}$ is $1$ if region $i$ and region $j$ share a boundary. Zero otherwise.
- $\delta_{ij}$ is $1$ if time $i$ comes immediately before or immediately after time $j$. Zero otherwise.

## Expected Counts as Offset Term {.smaller}
- 12 years of measurements across the 37 states in Nigeria
- Responses, $Y_{kt}$ are the number of newly diagnosed cases of Malaria (*plasmodium falciparum*) in state $k$ during year $t$.
- We calculate the expected number of cases in state $k$ during year $t$, $E_{kt}$, as 
$$E_{kt} = P_{kt}(\frac{\sum_{k}\sum_{t} Y_{kt}}{\sum_{k}\sum_{t} P_{kt}})$$
  + Where $P_{kt}$ is the population of state $k$ in year $t$.
  + That is, we expect a constant rate across all states and years
- The log of this term will be used as our offset in our model
 + Thus $\mu_{kt} = E_{kt}\exp({\beta x^T_k + \psi_{kt}})$
 + The term $\exp({\beta x^T_k + \psi_{kt}})$ is known as the relative risk


## Covariates
- Climate covariates included:
  + Mean of the average monthly temperature
  + Mean of the average monthly minimum temperature
  + Mean of the average monthly precipitation for each state
- Maximum temperature was not included due to collinearity with average monthly temperature
- Also include population
- Covariates are scaled using R's `scale()` function

## Fixed Effects Model
- We start by fitting a fixed effects model (ignoring spatio-temporal effects)
![](../../figures/GLMoutput.png)

## Fixed Effects Model
Using means as Bayes estimators of $\beta$, residuals of fixed effects model still show some spatio-temporal effects

![](../../figures/map_resid.png){fig-align="center"}

## Spatial Model {.smaller}
- Model with CAR modeled random spatial effect (no temporal effect)
- Lower DIC suggests much better fit
![](../../figures/GLM_Spatial.png)

## Spatial Model {.smaller}
Mean of Rho converges around $0.77$ suggesting strong spatial correlation. ![](../../figures/spatial_rho.png){width=85%}

## Spatio-temporal Model {.smaller}
- Model with CAR modeled random spatial and temporal effect
- Increased DIC value suggests any improvements in fit do not outweigh penalizations for extra parameters
- Possibly overfitting to our data
![](../../figures/GLM_spatiotemporal.png)

## Spatio-temporal Model {.smaller}
- Relatively high values for both correlation estimates suggest strong correlation of values with spatial or temporal closeness
![](../../figures/spatial_temporal_rho.png){width=85%}

## Results
- Non-zero credible intervals for all of our coefficient estimates
- Strong evidence for benefits of spatial modeling
- Benefits seen for spatio-temporal, but more work needs to be done to see if we are over-parameterizing our model


## Moving Forward
- Include more covariates in the model
  + Possibly socio-demographic factors
  + Latitude
- Experiment with different parameterizations or CAR priors
- Regional analysis by including more countries
